# WhisperSFML

Like the name WhisperSFML combines the OpenAI Whisper via Whisper.cpp and SFML to
demonstrate real-time audio transcription (Speak-To-Text) as well as translation.

## How To Use

- Get the WhisperSFML source code
- Make sure CMake and a compiler is installed

  - *I recommend at least base or small*
- (optional) Pick some sound file of your desire

- Build and run
  - *I recommend to run it in release mode*
